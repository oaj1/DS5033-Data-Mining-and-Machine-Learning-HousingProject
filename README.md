Housing Project

# Project One: House Prices

During the course of this project, you will learn to load, process, visualize and predict with housing data.
We will work through a series of steps:
1. Understand the Overarching Task
2. Acquire and Load the Data
3. Prepare the Data (for ML)
4. Selecting and Training an ML Model
5. Presenting an Analysis on the Solution

We will consolidate this notebook into three following steps:

* Broadly speaking, tasks 1-3 fall under Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* Then, task four encompulates several steps for price price prediction (the modeling side of things).
* Finally, we have our analysis in task five.


Due to some difficulties in acquiring a dataset on Texas and San Antonio housing, we will be relying on an
older dataset. For the purposes of learning, the data is still relevant.

For this project, the data is on Californian houses (when they were still affordable).  
The csv is also attached to the assignment.

* The dataset is available from: https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html
* You can also get the csv from: https://github.com/ageron/data/blob/main/housing/housing.csv
